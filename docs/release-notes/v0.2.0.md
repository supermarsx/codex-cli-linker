# v0.2.0

## Highlights
- Windows arm64 binary now available in Releases.
- All docs badges converted to flat-square style with clearer labels.

## Added
- Windows arm64 build artifact published with the other platforms.
- README and package metadata now include a Windows arm64 download button and asset reference.

## Changed
- Badges across README and dev docs now use `style=flat-square` and consistent labels (e.g., CI, Lint, Format, Test, Build, Release, Downloads, License, Python).
- Project version bumped to `0.2.0` in `pyproject.toml`.

## Fixed
- Minor inconsistencies in documentation links and badge labels.

## Verification
- Run `python3 -m py_compile codex-cli-linker.py` for a quick syntax check.
- Validate downloads in the latest GitHub Release; ensure platform binaries include Windows arm64.

## Thanks
Thanks to contributors for feedback on cross-platform support and docs polish.
