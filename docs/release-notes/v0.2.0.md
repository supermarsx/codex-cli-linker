# v0.2.0

## Highlights
- Windows arm64 binary now available (in addition to Windows x64, macOS x64/arm64, Linux x64/arm64).
- Documentation polish: all Shields.io badges are `flat-square` with clear, consistent labels.

## Downloads (Latest Release)
- Windows x64: `codex-cli-linker-windows-x64.exe`
- Windows arm64: `codex-cli-linker-windows-arm64.exe`
- macOS x64: `codex-cli-linker-macos-x64`
- macOS arm64: `codex-cli-linker-macos-arm64`
- Linux x64: `codex-cli-linker-linux-x64`
- Linux arm64: `codex-cli-linker-linux-arm64`

Direct buttons are also included in the README under the “Standalone executable” section.

## Added
- Windows arm64 build artifact and download button in the README and package metadata.
- Top-level changelog entry for 0.2.0 and detailed release notes (this file).

## Changed
- All documentation badges now use `style=flat-square` with clearer labels: `PyPI`, `PyPI downloads`, `Total downloads`, `Downloads`, `Release`, `Stars`, `Forks`, `Watchers`, `Issues`, `Commit activity`, plus CI workflow status labels (`CI`, `Lint`, `Format`, `Test`, `Build`, `Rolling`, `Release`, `PyPI`, `Scoop`, `Homebrew`).
- Bumped version to `0.2.0` in `pyproject.toml`.

## Fixed
- Minor inconsistencies in badge labels and links across docs.

## Upgrade Notes
- No breaking changes. If you pin a specific platform binary, you can switch to the new Windows arm64 asset on compatible devices.
- Config schema remains unchanged; no migrations required.

## Verification
- Quick sanity check: `python3 -m py_compile codex-cli-linker.py`.
- Confirm the latest GitHub Release includes the Windows arm64 artifact.
- Optional: run `codex-cli-linker --auto` to verify config output and backups at `~/.codex/` (or `$CODEX_HOME`).

## Thanks
Thanks to everyone who requested Windows arm64 support and helped refine docs for consistency and readability.
