## 0.1.3 - Logging subprocess fixes and broader test coverage

### Added
- Dedicated regression cases that cover remote logging, asynchronous queue draining, keychain `pass` CLI interactions, prompt detection helper signatures, and update-check entry points.
- Release metadata and notes describing the new guard rails for subprocess logging and CI verification.

### Changed
- The compatibility shim now mirrors `src` into `PYTHONPATH` before spawning subprocesses so doctor feature probes and other child processes import the local package consistently.
- Homebrew and Scoop packaging definitions point to the v0.1.3 artefacts; Scoop URL updated pending the freshly built Windows binary checksum.

### Fixed
- Remote logging subprocesses no longer crash with `ModuleNotFoundError`, restoring doctor feature probing when `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` is absent.

### Maintenance
- Verified formatting (`ruff`, `black`), the full pytest suite, and rebuilt distribution artefacts via `python -m build` in preparation for publishing.
